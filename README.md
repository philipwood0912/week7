# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!
### A electronic take on a classic game!
#### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisists: All you need is [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the directory - <code>cd directoryname</code> - and run the game.py file in the Python3 terminal window for Mac / Linux

The rules are the same as the classic game:
<ol>
 <li>Paper covers rock</li>
 <li>Scissors cuts paper</li>
 <li>Rock smashes scissors</li>
</ol>

<b><i>Choose your weapon wisely</i></b>

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with Python 3.

Enjoy!
